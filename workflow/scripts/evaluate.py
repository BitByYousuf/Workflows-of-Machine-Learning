# 1. it should take a file that has predictions
# 2. uses different evaluation metrics to evaluate the model like precision, recall, f1 score etc
# 3. save the metrics in a file
# 4. it should also create some visualizations (probably makes more sense to make another file called visualize.py for this idk will see later)
